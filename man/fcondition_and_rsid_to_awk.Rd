\usage{
fcondition_and_rsid_to_awk(
  fcondition,
  rsid_bash_index = get_file_interface(fcondition)$column_info["rsid", bash_index, on =
    "name"],
  index = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fcondition}{A filter_condition object}

\item{rsid_bash_index}{Awk column ref for RSID column (e.g., "$3")}

\item{index}{Counter for multiple genomic blocks (for unique array names)}
}
\value{
data.table with columns:
  - index: block index for unique naming
  - awk_code_block: awk code to load RSID array from dbSNP
  - print_prefix: awk code to prepend chr/pos to output
  - process_substitution: tabix query command
  - rsid_condition: awk condition to check RSID membership
  - condition: additional non-genomic conditions
  - variable_arrays, additional_files: from eval_fcondition_w_gregions
}
\description{
Combines two condition lists with a specified operator, merging their
variable_arrays and additional_files.
}
\details{
Convert filter condition with RSID matching to awk data.table

Handles files that use RSID-based indexing (files without chr/pos columns
that require dbSNP lookup). For RSID files with genomic conditions, uses
tabix to query dbSNP and creates awk code to match RSIDs.
