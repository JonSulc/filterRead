\item{fcondition2}{Second condition list}

\item{operation}{Awk operator string ("&&" or "||")}
}
\value{
List with `condition` as unnamed vector of conditions

Combined condition list with:
  - condition: combined condition string
  - variable_arrays: merged from both conditions
  - additional_files: merged from both conditions

Special OR handling for RSID-based files. Instead of combining into a
single awk condition, keeps conditions separate for multi-file processing
where each condition corresponds to a different tabix query.
