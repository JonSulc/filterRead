\title{Merge overlapping and contiguous genomic regions}
\usage{
merge_contiguous_regions(gregions)
}
\arguments{
\item{gregions}{A genomic_regions object}
}
\value{
genomic_regions with overlapping regions merged
}
\description{
Combines regions that overlap or are adjacent (end+1 == start) into
single regions. Compares each start with end of previous row.
}
\details{
Algorithm:
1. Sort by chr, start, end
2. For each chromosome, identify groups where start > previous end + 1
3. Merge each group to (min(start), max(end))
