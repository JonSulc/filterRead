\title{Determine column array setup for encoded/prefixed columns}
\usage{
get_awk_column_arrays(finterface, fcondition = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{finterface}{File interface with column_info containing encoding info}

\item{fcondition}{Optional filter condition (to determine which encoded
columns are needed for condition evaluation)}
}
\value{
List with:
  - before_if: awk split() calls for encoded columns used in conditions
  - after_if: awk code for column recoding and prefix addition
  Or NULL if no special column handling needed.
}
\description{
Analyzes file interface to determine which columns need splitting (for
encoded values like "A;B") or prefix addition. Returns awk code to be
executed before and after condition evaluation.
}
\details{
Encoded columns are split into arrays before condition checks (if needed
for filtering), then recombined after. Prefixes are added after filtering.
