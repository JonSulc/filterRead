\title{Generate awk code to load values from file into associative array}
\usage{
setup_variable_array(values, filename, variable_handle)
}
\arguments{
\item{values}{Vector of values to match against}

\item{filename}{Path to temp file where values will be written}

\item{variable_handle}{Name for the awk associative array}
}
\value{
Character string with awk code block for loading the array
}
\description{
For `%in%` operations, writes R values to a temp file and generates awk code
that reads the file and stores values in an associative array for O(1)
lookup. The array is populated when awk reads the temp file, before
processing the main data file.
}
\details{
The generated awk code uses FILENAME to detect when reading the temp file,
stores each line as an array key with value 1, then skips to next line.
Example output: `if (FILENAME == "/tmp/file123") { var123[$0] = 1; next }`
